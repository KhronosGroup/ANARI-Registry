# ANARI-Registry

The ANARI-Registry repository contains the ANARI 1.0-Provisional Specification.

It is also used as a backing store for the web view of the registry at
https://www.khronos.org/registry/ANARI/. Commits to the main branch of this
repository will be reflected there.

Interesting files in this repository include:

* `index.php` - toplevel index page for the web view. This relies on PHP
  include files found elsewhere on www.khronos.org and so is not very useful
  in isolation.
* `specs/` - ANARI specification documents.
